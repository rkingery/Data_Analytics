# Data_Analytics

These are the files I made for my data analytics class project in Fall 2017. Feel free to use or view whatever you wish. I apologize in advance for any unreadable code! I was just writing quick scripts for myself at the time. 

To understand the nature of the project (including the nature of the data set, data management and analysis techniques, and results), see the anomaly-detection-systems.pdf file.
